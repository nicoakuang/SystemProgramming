Race Condition:

What is it? When multiple threads or processes try to access and modify a shared resource without proper coordination.
Cause: Happens due to lack of synchronization like locking mechanisms.
Effect: Leads to unpredictable or incorrect results because different threads can interfere with each other.
Example: If two threads increment a shared variable without using locks, they might read and modify it at the same time, causing unexpected values.

No Race Condition:

What is it? When shared resources are accessed and modified in a coordinated way using synchronization techniques.
How: Achieved by using locks or similar mechanisms to ensure only one thread accesses the resource at a time.
Outcome: Ensures consistent and expected results from shared operations.
Example: Using a mutex to protect a shared variable ensures one thread modifies it at a time, avoiding conflicts and ensuring correct final values.
Comparison:

Race Condition: Results from uncoordinated access to shared resources, leading to unpredictable outcomes.
No Race Condition: Ensures synchronized access to shared resources, preventing conflicts and maintaining expected results.
