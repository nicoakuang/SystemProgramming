1. AND (&&) when  perform the operation AND 1 1:

The first operand is 1.
The second operand is 1.
According to the rules of Boolean logic:

1 AND 1 results in 1, because both operands are true (or non-zero in integer representation).
This is consistent with the basic principles of Boolean logic where the AND operation returns true (represented by 1 in computer implementations) if both operands are true.


2. when perform the operation OR 0 1:

The first operand is 0.
The second operand is 1.
In Boolean logic:

0 OR 1 results in 1, because at least one of the operands is 1.
This adheres to the basic rules of Boolean logic where the OR operation returns true (represented by 1 in computer implementations) if at least one operand is true.

my question is:

AND 1 1
OR 0 1
NOT 1
AND 0 0
OR 1 1
NOT 0

expected answer is:
Result: 1
Result: 1
Result: 0
Result: 0
Result: 1
Result: 1
