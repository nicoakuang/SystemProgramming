# Simple Stack-based Interpreter in C Language

**I used help of CHATGPT 60%**
This project implements a simple stack-based interpreter for a custom programming language. The interpreter reads programs written in the custom language and executes them sequentially. It supports basic operations such as arithmetic, input/output, and Basic Logic Operations. 

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition and subtraction operations on a stack.
- **Input/Output**: Allows reading input from the user and printing output.
- **Basic Logic Operations:**


## How to run

To use the interpreter, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Programs**: Write programs in the C language.
2. **Run Interpreter**: Execute the interpreter script `gcc -o countfile countfile.c` and provide the program file as input.

```bash
gcc -o countfile countfile.c
./countfile minus.nico 
./countfile plus.nico   
```

3. **View Output**: The interpreter will execute the program and display the output according to the program's logic.

## Example Programs

1. **Program 1**: Demonstrates simple count in math 
2. **Program 2**: Basic Logic Operations
3. **Program 3**: String manipulation
